## Tips for Best Results

1. **Choose the Right Model**: Different models excel at different types of images. Experiment to find the best one for your specific use case.

2. **Lighting Matters**: Images with good contrast between the subject and background typically yield better results.

3. **Use Alpha Matting**: For images with fine details like hair or fur, enable alpha matting and adjust the thresholds for improved edge detection.

4. **Combine Techniques**: For challenging images, try using a combination of chroma key and AI-based removal for the best results.

5. **Fine-tune with Mask Adjustments**: Use the mask expansion and feathering options to refine the edges of your subject.

6. **Experiment with Backgrounds**: Try different background modes (transparent, color, or image) to find the most suitable option for your project.

## Troubleshooting

- If the background removal is imperfect, try adjusting the alpha matting thresholds or using a different model.
- For subjects with similar colors to the background, experiment with the chroma key feature in combination with AI removal.
- If the resulting image looks unnatural, play with the shadow and color adjustment settings to better integrate the subject with the new background.
