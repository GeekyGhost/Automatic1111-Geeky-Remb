## Detailed Settings

### Input/Output Configuration

- **Input Type**:  
  Choose between **Image** or **Video**.

- **Foreground Upload**:  
  Upload your image or video content.

- **Output Type**:  
  Define whether the result will be an **Image** or **Video**.

---

### Foreground Adjustments

- **Scale**:  
  Adjust the size of the foreground between 0.1 to 5.0.

- **Aspect Ratio**:  
  Use ratios like `16:9` or terms like `portrait` or `square`.

- **Rotation & Position**:  
  Rotate the element from -360Â° to 360Â° and adjust **X/Y positions** within a -1000 to 1000 range.

- **Flip Options**:  
  Flip the foreground horizontally or vertically.

---

### Background Options

- **Remove Background**:  
  Use AI models (e.g., `u2net`) for automatic background removal.

- **Chroma Key**:  
  Select a chroma key color (green, blue, red) and set tolerance levels.

- **Background Mode**:  
  Options include **transparent**, **solid color**, **image**, or **video** backgrounds.

---

### Advanced Effects

- **Blending Modes**:  
  Choose from 10 blend modes:
  - **Normal**, **Multiply**, **Screen**, **Overlay**, **Soft Light**, **Hard Light**, **Difference**, **Exclusion**, **Color Dodge**, **Color Burn**.

- **Shadow and Edge Detection**:  
  Add shadows and edges with adjustable thickness and blur.

- **Alpha Matting**:  
  Fine-tune mask edges using alpha matting thresholds.

---

### Output Settings

- **Custom Dimensions**:  
  Enable to specify width and height manually.

- **Output Formats**:  
  Export images as PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and videos as MP4, AVI, or MOV.

- **Video Quality**:  
  Set video quality from 0-100 for optimized exports.

## Developer Guide

This extension is built with modular, extensible code. Below is an in-depth look at the core classes and methods.

---

### Core Classes and Functions

#### 1. **`GeekyRemB` Class**  
Manages sessions, background removal, threading, and GPU support.

- **`__init__()`**:  
  Initializes the session, checks for CUDA availability, and sets threading parameters.

#### 2. **`remove_background()` Method**  
Handles background removal, blending, chroma keying, and effect applications.  
**Parameters**:
- `model`: AI model to use for removal.
- `alpha_matting`: Enables edge refinement.
- `chroma_key`: Applies chroma key color.
- `blend_mode`: Blend mode for the result.
- `foreground_scale`: Controls the scale of the foreground.

This function processes both image and video inputs, performing transformations and applying custom background settings.

---

#### 3. **`apply_blend_mode()` Method**  
Applies one of 10 blending modes for compositing.

```python
def apply_blend_mode(target, blend, mode="normal", opacity=1.0):
    # Ensures both images have the same dimensions and channels
    result = self.blend_modes[mode](target, blend, opacity)
    return np.clip(result * 255, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)
```

Supported blend modes:
- **Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light, Difference, Exclusion, Color Dodge, Color Burn**

---

#### 4. **`process_video()` Method**  
Processes video frame-by-frame using threading for efficient execution.

```python
def process_video(input_path, output_path, background_video_path, *args):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(input_path)
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    # Process frames and write output
    ...
```

This function supports **CUDA-accelerated encoding** and uses **ffmpeg** for post-processing.

---

#### 5. **`parse_aspect_ratio()` Method**  
Interprets aspect ratios provided by the user. Accepts terms like `portrait`, `landscape`, or numerical ratios.

---

#### 6. **`calculate_new_dimensions()` Method**  
Calculates new dimensions based on scaling and aspect ratio.

```python
def calculate_new_dimensions(self, orig_width, orig_height, scale, aspect_ratio):
    new_width = int(orig_width * scale)
    new_height = int(new_width / aspect_ratio) if aspect_ratio else int(orig_height * scale)
    return new_width, new_height
```

---

## Performance Optimizations

- **GPU Support**: Automatically detects and leverages CUDA for faster video processing.
- **Thread Pooling**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to batch-process multiple frames.
- **Memory Management**: Dynamically controls batch size to optimize performance.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Edges are not smooth?**  
  Enable **alpha matting** and adjust thresholds for better results.

- **Chroma key not working correctly?**  
  Increase the **color tolerance** to capture more shades of the key color.

- **Output size not as expected?**  
  Use the **custom dimensions** feature to manually set the desired size.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Preview**: Provide live feedback for adjustments.
- **Animation Support**: Add keyframe-based animation for dynamic videos.
- **New Models**: Incorporate additional models for niche use cases.
